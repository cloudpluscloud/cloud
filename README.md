Resources for Code+ 2022 project "Demystifying Cloud Computing"

[[_TOC_]]

## Description

From the [2022 Code+ Project Proposals](https://codeplus.duke.edu/projects/demystifying-cloud-computing-duke): 

>A team of students will work with Duke’s Office of Information Technology, Co-Lab, Duke Learning Innovations (DLI), faculty, and academic units across Duke to investigate and improve the way in which virtual and cloud computing environments are utilized. 
>
>Students will research the landscape of environments such as Duke's own virtual computing manager (VCM), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. They will work with stakeholders across Duke to conduct requirements gathering, research what products are in use at Duke and the existing use cases and conduct a gap analysis. The students will develop functional processes and materials to educate others on best practices and common pitfalls. The team will build out development environments in virtual and cloud environments based on requirements identified by Duke faculty and staff. This project will lay the groundwork for infusing virtual and cloud computing in Duke’s infrastructure and ecosystem." 

## Background Reading

Disclosure: Your illustrious team leads haven't read/watched these resources in their entirety, but they seem like good introductions. There will certainly be a lot of repetition, so feel free to pick and choose those that resonate most with your learning style. PLEASE don't worry if you don't understand everything yet! Feel free to make a note of the topics you didn't understand but wish you did, and we can be sure to cover everything before the summer is over.

#### General Overviews

[Quick cloud overview with two embedded videos](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/cloud-computing)

[Cloud overview from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing)

[Everything you need to know about the Cloud](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cloud/)

A related topic is Containerization and Virtual Machines (VMs). [Here is a good introduction to these concepts](https://medium.com/geekculture/introduction-to-containers-basics-of-containerization-bb60503df931).

Here is an introduction to a commonly-used container software, [Docker](https://turbofuture.com/computers/introductiontodocker).

#### Vendor-Specific

Here is an introduction to [Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeMYQ-qJeK4) services using a web application as an example use case. It also includes a nice introduction of everything that goes into hosting a web application, but definitely goes into a LOT of details that might feel overwhelming.

Duke has it's own cloud service called [Virtual Computing Manager](https://vcm.duke.edu/help)

#### Longer Courses

[LinkedIn Learning Path: Understanding Cloud Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/understanding-cloud-fundamentals?u=77842946)

#### Hands-On Tutorials

AWS has some [tutorials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html#tutorials) that you can do by using their "Free Tier" account. You'll need to set up an AWS account, but won't need to pay anything.

## Proposed Organizational Tools

* GitLab: code and documents
* Teams: chat
* Kanban on Teams: task boards
* Wiki on Teams: daily journal/summaries

## Expectations

* Daily Standups
    * Quickly answer three questions:
        * What did I work on yesterday?
        * What am I working on today?
        * What issues are blocking me?
    * Vicki as [Scrum Master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master)

* End-of-day Written Summaries
    * Answer the three questions you will discuss at the next morning's standup (see above)
    * Can go into more detail than you will at the standup if needed
    * Read each other's written summaries before standup; be prepared with questions

* End-of-week Reflections
    * Demo
    * Brief discussion of week: what went well, what can improve
    * Entire team practices delivering 30-60 second project pitch

* Others TBD

# Template for Future README sections

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
